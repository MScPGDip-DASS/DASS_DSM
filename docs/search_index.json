[["index.html", "Data Science Modelling About", " Data Science Modelling Dr. Ioana Macoveciuc About Welcome to SOST70033 Data Science Modelling! This notebook will host the materials for all R practical tasks for this course unit. The notebook follows the same section-based structure as the learning materials on Blackboard. For each section, you will have at least one practical to complete and each of these can be accessed by using the sidebar menu on the left hand side of your screen. When there are multiple exercises, clicking on the headings in each section will expand the menu and you can access each task individually. To access this notebook, you can bookmark it like any other website in your favourite web browser. The sidebar menu can be toggled on and off by clicking on the Toggle Sidebar button. Other customisation options include changing the font, font size, and the appearance. You also have a handy search button. This notebook is also designed to work well on tablet and mobile devices; to enhance your experience on these devices, it is recommended that you hide the sidebar menu and navigate across sections and subsections using the right and left arrows. 1: Before beginning, it is recommended that you create a RStudio project for this course and work through the exercises and tasks in each section using this project. 2: You should write and save your answers to the exercises and tasks in R scripts. You should have at least one R script for each course section. 3: The recommended approach for a ‘clean’ working directory is to place all the data files you plan to use in a separate folder (e.g. a folder called data) within your R project working directory. You should always use simple names that allow you easy access to the contents when you want to either explore the folder on your machine or specify the path to these folders in R. 4: The answers to all tasks are also provided in this notebook. To build a robust knowledge basis and adequately develop your practical programming skills, it is absolutely essential that you first attempt all tasks and exercises on your own before comparing your answers with those provided in this notebook. To facilitate this, the R code, R output, and explanations are ‘hidden’, but these can be individually revealed by clicking on their respective toggle buttons.

Reference James, G., Witten, D., Hastie, T. and Tibshirani, R. (2021). An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R. 2nd ed. New York: Springer. https://www.statlearning.com/ PART I For the tasks below, you will require the College dataset. Click here to download the file: College.csv . Remember to place your data file in a separate subfolder within your R project working directory. This data file contains 18 variables for 777 different universities and colleges in the United States. The variables are: Private : Public/private indicator Apps : Number of applications received Accept : Number of applicants accepted Enroll : Number of new students enrolled Top10perc : New students from top 10% of high school class Top25perc : New students from top 25% of high school class F.Undergrad : Number of full-time undergraduates P.Undergrad : Number of part-time undergraduates Outstate : Out-of-state tuition Room.Board : Room and board costs Books : Estimated book costs Personal : Estimated personal spending PhD : Percent of faculty with Ph.D.’s Terminal : Percent of faculty with terminal degree S.F.Ratio: Student/faculty ratio perc.alumni : Percent of alumni who donate Expend : Instructional expenditure per student Grad.Rate : Graduation rate Task 1 Import the dataset using a suitable tidyverse function and name this object college. Code # Remember to load tidyverse first library(tidyverse) college &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/College.csv&quot;) If you have a look at the contents of the data object using View(), you will notice that the first column contains the names of all of the universities in the dataset. You will also notice that it has a strange name. Actually, these data should not be treated as a variable (column) since it is just a list of university names. TASK 2 Keeping the list of names in the data object, transform this column such that the university names in the column become row names. Hint: use the column_to_rownames() function from dplyr. Code college &lt;- college %&gt;% column_to_rownames(var = &quot;...1&quot;) How would have your approach to this task differed if you would have imported the dataset using base R? Try it! The data file could have instead been imported using read.csv(): college &lt;- read.csv(\"data/College.csv\") Using the base R approach, the first column containing the university names would have been named “X”, as shown below using View(). Now, how would be go about transforming the contents of the first column into row names? This would require two steps. First, we assign the column contents to rows names. rownames(college) &lt;- college[, 1] If you have another look at the data object, you will see that the rows have now been renamed using the university names in the “X” column, but the column is still part of the dataset. We therefore need to tell R to delete the column. college &lt;- college[, -1] TASK 3 Create a scatterplot matrix of the first three numeric variables.
